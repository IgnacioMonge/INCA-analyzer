# INCA-analyzer
Matlab script for analyzing INCA PV loops data

This is a self-made MATLAB script for analyzing pressure and volume data from the INCA system.
This script calculates the usual parameters derived from the PV analysis: Ees (also single-beat Ees with a 5th order polynomial), Ea, EDV, ESV, EF, PRSW, SW, VAC, LV dPdtmax, etc... It also analyzes diastolic funciton by the non-linear fit of EDPVR (beta index) and different tau calculations . It also provides estimation of the atrial function and contribution to the LV filling.

Please, consider that I am not an engineer, I'm a dedicated physician to critical care patients with a deep pasion for physiology.
